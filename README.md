# AMT: Agentic Machine Translation for Long Documents

## 1. Introduction

This repository accompanies our ongoing research on **Agentic Machine Translation (AMT)**, a framework designed for translating long-form documents. Unlike short text segments, long documents pose challenges such as preserving **semantic fidelity**, maintaining **discourse coherence**, ensuring **terminology consistency**, and retaining **structural elements** (e.g., figures, tables, equations). Our work explores **agentic strategies** with large language models to address these challenges in a structured and process-oriented manner.

> Since the paper is currently under review, we only provide a high-level overview here without disclosing the full methodology.

## 2. Resources

This repository provides the resources used in our study to enable transparency and facilitate further exploration:

* **Dataset**
  A collection of long-form documents from diverse domains (management, education, economics, research, etc.).
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Many of these documents are copyrighted materials. To comply with copyright restrictions, we cannot release them publicly. Researchers interested in accessing the dataset may request it from us directly.*

* **Translation Evaluation Sheet**
  The evaluation rubric used by annotators to assess translation quality.
  It covers multiple dimensions including adequacy, fluency, terminology consistency, coherence, and structural integrity.

* **Annotation Results**
  The complete set of human evaluation scores collected during the study.
  This includes both detailed per-document ratings and aggregated overall results.
